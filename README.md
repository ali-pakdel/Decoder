# Encoded Text Decoding with Genetic Algorithm

This project focuses on decoding encoded text using a **Genetic Algorithm**. The algorithm generates a population of candidate keys and improves them through crossover and mutation, eventually revealing the decoded text.

## What is Genetic Algorithm?

**Genetic Algorithm (GA)** serves as a powerful optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. It constructs and evolves a population of potential solutions by applying genetic operators like mutation and crossover to find the most suitable solution.

## Objectives

In this project, our primary objectives are as follows:

1. **Defining Genetic Algorithm Terms:**
   - Establishing clear definitions for crucial terms such as **Gene**, **Chromosome**, and **Fitness Function** in the context of our text decoding problem.

2. **Initial Population Generation:**
   - Forming the initial population of candidate keys, each representing a possible decryption key.

3. **Fitness Function:**
   - Defining and implementing a **Fitness Function** to evaluate the fitness of potential decryption keys based on how well they decode the text.

4. **Crossover and Mutation:**
   - Implementing the processes of **Crossover** and **Mutation** to evolve and refine the decryption keys within the population.

5. **Algorithm Execution:**
   - Running the genetic algorithm to effectively decode the encoded text.

By achieving these goals, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms in solving the challenge of decoding encoded text with a 14-letter key.
